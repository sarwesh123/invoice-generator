//Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build designs directly in your markup. Let's break down the configuration file:

module.exports = {
  //specifies the files where Tailwind CSS will search for classes. In this case, it includes all JavaScript and TypeScript files in the src directory and its subdirectories.
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        Opensans: "'Open Sans', sans-serif",
      },
    },
  },
  //It allows you to include Tailwind CSS plugins to extend its functionality.
//In this case, the @tailwindcss/forms plugin is included. This plugin provides styles for form elements, making it easier to style forms using Tailwind CSS classes.
  plugins: [require('@tailwindcss/forms')],
};
